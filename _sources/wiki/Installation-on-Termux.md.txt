# Install Buku on [Termux](https://termux.com/)
## Main buku package installation
First, you must have around 1GB of storage space for build dependencies. 
Next steps will set you up with working Python environment, the package manager `pip`, and several build dependencies.
You may receive various build errors ([1](https://github.com/jarun/Buku/issues/395)) if you don't install these manually.

```shell
pgk upgrade
# Install Python, pip and needed packages
pkg install python libcrypt libffi clang openssl rust
```
For rust cryptography, before buku package installation, you need to set system type otherwise you might get build [errors](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6679).

```shell
rustc --print target-list
# Choose architecture and set env variable
export CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-linux-android

```

Finally, run the following, which should install any remaining dependencies together with Buku itself:

```shell
pip install buku
```

## Start bukuserver
You can use bukuserver locally on termux with these simple commands
```shell
pip intsall "buku[server]"
# Start server
bukuserver run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5001
```
You can open your browser, and navigate to site with url `127.0.0.1:5001`.

## Cleanup some build dependencies (~600MB)
```shell
pkg uninstall clang rust llvm
```
## Backup and import buku database
Bind termux storage to android, in termux storage/shared -> /storage/emulated/0.
```shell
termux-setup-storage
```
Export to sql3 format:
```shell
buku --export storage/shared/bookmarks.db
```
When importing:
```shell
# OPTIONAL: delete all bookmarks from buku database
buku -d
# Import database
buku --import storage/shared/bookmarks.db
```
