`buku` allows you to customize the color scheme via a five-letter string, reminiscent of BSD `LSCOLORS`. The five letters represent the colors of

- index
- title
- url
- description/comment/note
- tag

respectively. The five-letter string is passed in either as the argument to the `--colors` option, or as the value of the environment variable `BUKU_COLORS`.

We offer the following colors/styles:

Letter | Color/Style
------ | -----------
a      | black
b      | red
c      | green
d      | yellow
e      | blue
f      | magenta
g      | cyan
h      | white
i      | bright black
j      | bright red
k      | bright green
l      | bright yellow
m      | bright blue
n      | bright magenta
o      | bright cyan
p      | bright white
A-H    | bold version of the lowercase-letter color
I-P    | bold version of the lowercase-letter bright color
x      | normal
X      | bold
y      | reverse video
Y      | bold reverse video

The default colors string is `oKlxm`, which stands for

- bright cyan index
- bold bright green title
- bright yellow url
- normal description
- bright blue tag

Note that

- Bright colors (implemented as `\x1b[90m`â€“`\x1b[97m`) may not be available in all color-capable terminal emulators;
- Some terminal emulators draw bold text in bright colors instead;
- Some terminal emulators only distinguish between bold and bright colors via a default-off switch.

Please consult the manual of your terminal emulator as well as the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) on ANSI escape sequences.

#### Windows support

By default colors are disabled on Windows because cmd doesn't understand POSIX color sequences. However,

- option `--colors` enables colors
- environment variable `BUKU_COLORS`, if set, enables colors
- `buku` can detect ConEmu and show color codes
